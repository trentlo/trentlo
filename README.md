- 👋 Hi, I’m Trent Lo (@trentlo)
- 🌱 I started my computer science journey working on research projects related to system-level modeling/simulation. I constructed various simulators in C++ and SystemC, utilizing compiler techniques. That is how I started to understand the intriguing compiler optimizations. At the same time, I learnt to read and even write some Verilog to understand how hardware works.
- 🌱 Later, I worked on various compiler projects such as OpenCL and then specialized in Deep Learning compilers.
