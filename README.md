- 👋 Hi, I’m Trent Lo (@trentlo)
- 🌱 I started my Computer Science journey working on research projects related to system-level modeling/simulation. I constructed various simulators in C++ and SystemC, utilizing compiler techniques. That is how I started to understand the intriguing compiler optimizations. At the same time, I learnt to read and even write some Verilog to understand how hardware works.
- 🌱 Later, I had opportinities to work on various compiler projects such as OpenCL. Now I focus on Deep Learning Compilers.
- 💞️ You can find my previous publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=RjymzN8AAAAJ&hl=en) and more details about my previous projects on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-lo-06089042).
